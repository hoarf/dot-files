;; My Directory Location

;;    Normally, the =user-emacs-directory= stores everything in a
;;    =.emacs.d= directory in the home directory, however, Aquamacs
;;    overrides that, and since I now feel the need to use these settings
;;    for both editors (sure feels like XEmacs all over again).

;;    Any way, I have a new global variable for that:


(defconst ha/emacs-directory (concat (getenv "HOME") "/.emacs.d/"))

(defun ha/emacs-subdirectory (d) (expand-file-name d ha/emacs-directory))

;; Directory Structure

;;    In case this is the first time running this on a computer, we need
;;    to make sure the following directories have been created.


(let* ((subdirs '("elisp" "backups" "snippets" "ac-dict"))
       (fulldirs (mapcar (lambda (d) (ha/emacs-subdirectory d)) subdirs)))
  (dolist (dir fulldirs)
    (when (not (file-exists-p dir))
      (message "Make directory: %s" dir)
      (make-directory dir))))

;; Customization Section

;;    While I would rather program my configurations, sometimes the Emacs
;;    menu system is "good enough", but I want it in its own file:


(setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" ha/emacs-directory))
(when (file-exists-p custom-file)
  (load custom-file))

;; Setting up the Load Path

;;    Extra packages not available via the package manager go in my

;; Package Manager

;;    Emacs has become like every other operating system, and now has a

;;    sweet goodness, I demand.

(use-package goto-chg

         ("M-n" . goto-last-change-reverse)))



;; Use =C-u 0 M-p= shows a description of the change you made at each point.

;; However, if walking back through your /historical trail/ crosses
;; files, then dropping some phat marks is the correct approach.

;; Leave a mark every time I re-center the screen. Then, walk back and
;; forth through its history (using the [[https://github.com/pheaver/breadcrumb][breadcrumb]] project):


(use-package breadcrumb
  :load-path "~/Other/breadcrumb/"
  :commands bc-set bc-previous bc-next
  :init (defun ha/mark-and-center ()
          "Recenter the display and drops a breadcrumb."

;; Smart Comments

;;    The [[https://github.com/paldepind/smart-comment][smart-comment]] project has the nice feature of commenting a line
;;    without being at the beginning of the line (default comment in the

(use-package smart-comment

;; Strip Whitespace on Save

;; Better Searching and Visual Regular Expressions

;;    Searching is quite good in Emacs. Let's add a few extra keys:


(bind-keys :map isearch-mode-map
           ("<left>"  . isearch-repeat-backward)
           ("<right>" . isearch-repeat-forward)
           ("<up>"    . isearch-ring-retreat)
           ("<down>"  . isearch-ring-advance))



;; Easier replacement of my [[http://www.masteringemacs.org/articles/2011/01/14/effective-editing-movement/][Smart Scan]] for searching forward/backward
;; for the current word. This is now bound to =M-s .= (in Emacs 24.4),
;; but I then have to hit =C-s= or =C-r= ... nicer to use the period/comma.

;; The [[https://github.com/benma/visual-regexp.el][Visual Regular Expressions]] project highlights the matches
;; while you try to remember the differences between Perl's regular
;; expressions and Emacs'...

;; Begin with =C-c r= then type the regexp. To see the highlighted
;; matches, type =C-c a= before you hit 'Return' to accept it.


(use-package visual-regexp
  :ensure t
  :init
  (use-package visual-regexp-steroids :ensure t)

  :bind (("C-c r" . vr/replace)
         ("C-c q" . vr/query-replace))

  ;; if you use multiple-cursors, this is for you:
  :config (use-package  multiple-cursors
            :bind ("C-c m" . vr/mc-mark)))

;; Flycheck

;;    [[https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck][Flycheck]] seems to be quite superior to good ol' Flymake.

  :init
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-flycheck-mode)
  :config
  (setq-default flycheck-disabled-checkers '(emacs-lisp-checkdoc)))

;; Table and Column Alignment

;;    While I shouldn't, I like to line up comma-separated columns (and
;;    colon-delimited hashes), and since I can never type the regular
;;    expression on the first time, I wrapped it up in a callable
;;    function.


(defun align-comma (start end c)
  "Repeat alignment with a character padded with spaces for
comma-separated columns."
  (interactive "r\nsAlign character: ")
  (align-regexp start end

;; ElDoc

;;     I like ElDoc support (when I can get it), but not needed in the

;; We access stuff by loading the =etags= package:


(require 'etags)



;; Now, use the following keys:

;; - M-. :: To find the tag at point to jump to the function’s
;;          definition when the point is over a function call. It is a
;;          dwim-type function.
;; - M-, :: jump back to where you were.
;; - M-? :: find a tag, that is, use the Tags file to look up a
;;          definition. If there are multiple tags in the project with
;;          the same name, use `C-u M-.’ to go to the next match.
;; - =M-x tags-search= :: regexp-search through the source files
;;      indexed by a tags file (a bit like =grep=)
;; - =M-x tags-query-replace= :: query-replace through the source files
;;      indexed by a tags file
;; - =M-x tags-apropos= :: list all tags in a tags file that match a
;;      regexp
;; - =M-x list-tags= :: list all tags defined in a source file

;; With the fancy new [[https://marmalade-repo.org/packages/ctags-update][ctags-update]] package, we can update the tags file
;; whenever we save a file:


(use-package ctags-update
  :ensure t
  :config
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook  'turn-on-ctags-auto-update-mode)
  :diminish ctags-auto-update-mode)



;; While, I like =imenu=, [[https://github.com/vspinu/imenu-anywhere][combining it]] with an IDO interface nicely
;; lists the headings/functions in the current buffer:


(use-package idomenu

  :bind ("C-c i" . idomenu))



;; And if I'm lazy and willing to use the mouse:


(use-package imenu+
  :ensure t
  :init (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'imenup-add-defs-to-menubar)
        (add-hook 'org-mode-hook  'imenup-add-defs-to-menubar))



;; If I don't know what I'm after, Helm is better:


(use-package helm
  :bind (("C-c M-i" . helm-imenu)))



;; However, I need to use [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EtagsSelect#toc3][this function]] to use IDO in conjunctions
;; with the TAGS file for all functions in the project:


(use-package ido
  :config
  (defun ido-find-tag ()
    "Find a tag using ido"
    (interactive)
    (tags-completion-table)
    (let (tag-names)
      (mapatoms (lambda (x)
                  (push (prin1-to-string x t) tag-names))
                tags-completion-table)
      (find-tag (ido-completing-read "Tag: " tag-names))))

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-c I") 'ido-find-tag))



;; Note: This prompt needs to go away:


(setq tags-add-tables nil)

;; Code Block Folding

;;     The [[info:emacs#Hideshow][Hide Show Minor]] mode allows us to /fold/ all functions
;;     (hidden), showing only the header lines. We need to turn on the
;;     mode, so wrappers are in order:


(defun ha/hs-show-all ()
  (interactive)
  (hs-minor-mode 1)
  (hs-show-all))

(defun ha/hs-hide-all ()
  (interactive)
  (hs-minor-mode 1)
  (hs-hide-all))

(defun ha/hs-toggle-hiding ()
  (interactive)
  (hs-minor-mode 1)
  (hs-toggle-hiding))



;; Seems that =C-c @= is too obnoxious to use, so I'll put my
;; favorite on the =C-c h= prefix:


(use-package hs-minor-mode
  :bind
  ("C-c T h" . hs-minor-mode)
  ("C-c h a" . ha/hs-hide-all)
  ("C-c h s" . ha/hs-show-all)
  ("C-c h h" . ha/hs-toggle-hiding))

;; Aggressive Auto Indention

;;     Automatically indent without use of the tab found in [[http://endlessparentheses.com/permanent-auto-indentation.html][this article]],
;;     and seems to be quite helpful for many types of programming
;;     languages.

;;     To begin, we create a function that can indent a function by
;;     calling =indent-region= on the beginning and ending points of a
;;     function.


(defun indent-defun ()
  "Indent current defun.
Do nothing if mark is active (to avoid deactivaing it), or if
buffer is not modified (to avoid creating accidental
modifications)."
  (interactive)
  (unless (or (region-active-p)
              buffer-read-only
              (null (buffer-modified-p)))
    (let ((l (save-excursion (beginning-of-defun 1) (point)))
          (r (save-excursion (end-of-defun 1) (point))))
      (cl-letf (((symbol-function 'message) #'ignore))
        (indent-region l r)))))



;; Next, create a hook that will call the =indent-defun= with every
;; command call:


(defun activate-aggressive-indent ()
  "Locally add `ha/indent-defun' to `post-command-hook'."
  (add-hook 'post-command-hook
            'indent-defun nil 'local))

;; Red Warnings

;; Emacs Lisp

;;    The [[https://github.com/ankurdave/color-identifiers-mode][color-identifiers]] project (unlike [[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-identifiers][others]]), downplay the

;; Paredit

;; Nicer Paren Matching

;;     The reverse mode of the default parenthesis matching doesn’t match
;;     as well, so [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ShowParenMode][this code]] just makes it bold and more obvious:


(use-package paren

  (set-face-foreground 'show-paren-mismatch "#c66")
  (set-face-attribute  'show-paren-mismatch nil :weight 'black))



;; While we are at it, let's dim the parens:

;; Insert Comment of Eval
